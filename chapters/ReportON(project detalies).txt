Abstract

This report presents FollowUp, a smart mobile-based field management system developed for Al-Bireh Municipality. The system aims to improve the monitoring and management of municipal field workers such as sanitation staff, inspectors, and maintenance teams.
Traditionally, field worker supervision in municipalities relies on manual attendance records, verbal task assignment, and paper-based reporting. These methods are often inefficient, time-consuming, and prone to errors, especially when managing a distributed workforce operating across different geographic zones.
FollowUp provides a digital solution that integrates GPS tracking, geofencing, task management, and field issue reporting within a single mobile application. Attendance is automatically recorded when workers enter or exit predefined work zones, while supervisors are able to assign tasks, monitor progress, and receive completion evidence through photos and location data. The system also supports offline operation, allowing workers to continue using the application in areas with limited internet connectivity and synchronizing data automatically once a connection becomes available.
The system is implemented using a mobile application supported by backend services and is integrated with the municipality s Geographic Information System (GIS) to define and validate official work zones. An Arabic-first user interface with right-to-left support is provided to ensure usability for non-technical users.
The proposed system enhances transparency, accountability, and operational efficiency in municipal field operations. It also provides a scalable foundation for future enhancements such as advanced reporting, dashboard analytics, and integration with additional municipal systems.

Chapter 1: Introduction

1.1 General Overview
The project introduces a smart, mobile-based system designed to digitally monitor and manage field workers for Al-Bireh Municipality. The municipality s daily operations, such as sanitation, inspection, and emergency response, depend on a distributed workforce performing tasks across various zones. However, traditional supervision methods, including manual attendance and paper-based reporting, lack efficiency and transparency.
This system offers a modern solution by using mobile and GPS technologies to automate attendance, track worker locations, manage task workflows, and report field issues. It supports Arabic language interfaces and offline mode to meet the needs of all users, including non-technical field workers. The system also integrates with existing GIS data provided by the municipality in the form of shapefiles to define geofenced work zones.
By improving visibility into field operations, this solution enables better planning, accountability, and resource allocation, forming a practical step toward digital transformation in public service delivery.

1.2 Motivation
Municipalities rely heavily on field workers to perform essential tasks such as cleaning public areas, enforcing regulations, and responding to emergencies. Despite the importance of these roles, many municipalities, including Al-Bireh, still use outdated methods to supervise and track field operations. These methods include physical attendance logs, verbal task delegation, and delayed paper-based reporting, which are prone to errors, inefficiencies, and manipulation.
This lack of digital oversight creates significant challenges in workforce accountability, operational planning, and service quality. Supervisors often struggle to confirm worker presence, verify task completion, or identify issues encountered in the field. Employees are also required to visit the municipality headquarters to record attendance, resulting in wasted time and resources.
The motivation for this project arises from the need to modernize and streamline these daily operations. By introducing a mobile and web-based system that automates attendance, tracks tasks, and integrates GIS data provided by the municipality as shapefiles, the project delivers a reliable, scalable, and user-friendly solution. The system reduces administrative workload, improves transparency, and supports informed decision-making, ultimately enhancing municipal service delivery and worker accountability.

1.3 Method
To achieve the objectives of this project, a structured and research-driven approach was adopted, beginning with identifying real challenges faced by Al-Bireh Municipality in managing its field workforce. This was accomplished through direct discussions with municipal staff and an analysis of their current operational practices, including manual attendance tracking, verbal task assignments, and delayed reporting.
After clearly defining the problem, related systems and existing solutions were reviewed to identify 
best practices and limitations. Based on these findings, a system design was proposed that addresses the municipality s specific needs. The design emphasizes usability, Arabic language support, offline functionality, and seamless integration with GIS data provided by the municipality as shapefiles.
The development phase followed an agile methodology. Core components such as attendance tracking, task workflows, GPS monitoring, and issue reporting were implemented and tested in iterative cycles. The system integrates a mobile application developed using Flutter, a backend implemented using ASP.NET Core 9 with a SQL Server database, and a web dashboard built with React for supervisory functions.
This method ensures that the solution is based on real operational needs, technically feasible, and flexible enough to support future enhancements.

1.4 Aim and Objectives
1.4.1 Aim 
To design and develop a mobile-first intelligent system that enables Al-Bireh Municipality to digitally monitor and manage its field workforce through automated attendance logging, GPS-based tracking, task assignment, incident reporting, and performance analysis. The system is delivered through an Arabic-first interface with full offline capability.
1.4.2 Objectives
* Automate worker attendance using GPS-based geofencing and track real-time movement within assigned work zones.
* Enable supervisors to assign and monitor tasks and receive completion proof through text or photo evidence.
* Allow workers to report field issues using GPS-tagged photos and predefined issue types.
* Integrate GIS data provided by the municipality as shapefiles to define, manage, and validate work zones.
* Ensure system reliability through offline functionality, secure data storage, authenticated access, and a simple Arabic interface to support non-technical users.
* Provide supervisors with basic monitoring and reporting capabilities to review attendance records, task status, and field activities through a centralized dashboard.

1.5 Overview of the Technical Area
The technical scope of this project spans several key areas in mobile computing, location-based services, and cloud-connected data management. At its core, the system is implemented using a cross-platform mobile framework, Flutter, to ensure compatibility with a wide range of Android and iOS devices used by field employees.
A central component of the system is GPS tracking and geofencing, which enable automated attendance logging and route monitoring. These technologies allow the system to detect when a worker enters or exits a designated work zone and to validate movement within official municipal boundaries.
Task assignment, incident reporting, and performance tracking are managed through a unified backend implemented using ASP.NET Core 9 with a SQL Server database. This backend provides authentication, data storage, and secure communication between mobile and web users. Offline functionality is supported through local data persistence using Hive, ensuring uninterrupted operation in areas with limited connectivity.
Additionally, the system integrates GIS data provided by the municipality in the form of shapefiles to define and update operational zones. Other technical aspects include an Arabic-first user interface, role-based access control, encrypted data handling, and synchronized data exchange once connectivity is restored.
Together, these technologies create a scalable and user-friendly platform for digitally managing field operations in the public sector.

Chapter 2:  Background

This chapter provides the foundational knowledge necessary to understand the design choices and implementation of the FollowUp field worker management system. It is divided into three main sections:
* The first section presents the relevant theoretical and technical concepts that the system is built upon, such as GPS, GIS, role-based access control, and offline-first architecture.
* The second section reviews existing commercial systems, analyzing their strengths, limitations, and relevance to municipal field operations. 
* The final section describes the tools and technologies used in the implementation of the system, along with justification for each choice based on performance, scalability, and localization requirements.
Together, these sections form the conceptual and technical basis for the system s architecture and implemented features.

2.1 Details of Relevant Theory
 2.1.1 GPS and Geofencing
Global Positioning System (GPS) is a satellite-based navigation technology that enables the system to determine the real-time geographic location of a user. Geofencing builds upon GPS by defining virtual boundaries around physical areas. When a user enters or exits a defined geofence, the system can automatically trigger context-aware actions such as attendance logging or movement alerts.
These mechanisms are widely used in employee monitoring systems to reduce manual reporting and improve accuracy [1]. Research also supports combining GPS and geofencing for workforce tracking, showing strong results in terms of precision, automation, and scalability [2].
In the implemented system, GPS and geofencing are used to validate worker presence within official municipal work zones during attendance and task execution.
2.1.2 Mobile-Based Systems
Mobile-based systems allow users to access services anytime and anywhere using portable devices such as smartphones and tablets. These systems are particularly valuable for field workers who require lightweight and easy-to-use tools for task management and reporting.
The adoption of cross-platform frameworks such as Flutter has significantly improved the efficiency of developing mobile applications that run on both Android and iOS devices, which is suitable for diverse field environments.
2.1.3 Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
Geographic Information Systems (GIS) enable the management, analysis, and visualization of spatial data. In municipal environments, GIS plays a key role in defining operational zones and supporting location-based decision-making.
In this project, GIS is used to define municipal work zones and support location-aware validation for attendance and task tracking. The GIS data is provided by Al-Bireh Municipality in the form of shapefiles rather than APIs, ensuring accurate representation of real municipal boundaries.



2.1.4 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a security approach in which system access is granted based on the user s assigned role, such as worker, supervisor, or administrator. RBAC ensures that users can only access data and functionalities relevant to their responsibilities.
This approach improves data security and prevents unauthorized access to sensitive municipal information.
2.1.5 Offline-First Architecture and Synchronization
Due to weak internet connectivity in some field areas, adopting an offline-first architecture is essential. This design allows users to continue performing core operations such as attendance logging, task updates, and issue reporting even when temporarily disconnected from the network.
In the implemented system, data is stored locally using Hive and automatically synchronized with the central SQL Server database once connectivity is restored. The synchronization mechanism preserves the original event timestamps, ensuring that recorded data reflects the actual work time rather than the upload time.
Recent studies identify offline-first architectures as a fault-tolerant design pattern for mobile and field-based systems deployed in unreliable network environments [3].

Application Layer: Includes front-end components such as Task Management, Attendance Logging, GIS Zone Validation, and Field Reporting. These components serve as entry points for user interactions.
Domain Layer: Contains key interfaces and logic modules that bridge user-facing components with the underlying infrastructure. This includes services such as AuthService, TaskService, AttendanceService, and GeoValidationService.
Infrastructure & Integration Layer: Represents backend and integration services such as ASP.NET Core API Endpoints, SQL Server Database, Notification Service, and the GIS Validation Engine that processes shapefiles for zone verification.
The diagram visualizes how components are modularized, how they communicate through interfaces, and how they depend on backend APIs and external GIS data for storage, authentication, and validation.

3.4.4 Deployment Diagram
Figure 3.13 illustrates the deployment architecture of the Field Workforce Management System. The system is structured into four main deployment zones: Mobile Frontend, Web Frontend, Backend Server, and External Services. Each device hosts specific software artifacts that encapsulate functional components responsible for system operation.
Mobile Device (Android / iOS): Hosts the deployed FlutterApp.apk artifact, containing components such as Login UI, Sync Engine, Notification Listener, Attendance UI, and Tasks UI.
Web Browser: Loads the SupervisorPortal.html (React) artifact, which includes components such as Reports UI, Map View, Task Management UI, and User Management.
Application Server (ASP.NET Core 9 + SQL Server): Hosts the main backend services encapsulated in BackendService, containing core modules such as Identity & Authentication, REST API Controllers, Database Access Layer (EF Core), File Storage Handler, and Notification Engine (FCM).
External GIS Server: An external service that hosts the GIS Validation Engine, which provides geolocation zone verification using shapefiles supplied by the municipality. Secure communication is enforced via HTTPS + TLS between mobile/web clients and the backend.
Runtime communication paths are illustrated, showing direct interactions between key components for example, the Sync Engine exchanges data with the backend API, while the Login UI interacts with the Authentication Controller as part of the login flow.

3.5 Data Management and ERD
This section outlines how data is structured, stored, and manipulated throughout the Field Workforce Management System.
The system relies on a relational SQL Server database managed through the ASP.NET Core 9 backend, with tables and relationships designed around key business entities such as users, tasks, attendance logs, reports, and notifications.
All operations follow secure, authenticated access and support offline storage and synchronization mechanisms via local caching and sync queues implemented using Hive on the mobile side.

Figure 3.14: Entity-Relationship Diagram - Logical Data Model of the System
The data is centered around a generalized User entity, which is extended by three specialized roles: Admin, Supervisor, and Worker.
Workers are assigned to geographic Zones managed by supervisors and receive Tasks, which may require submitting Field Reports, logging Attendance, or triggering system Notifications.
Offline operations are handled by a dedicated OfflineSync entity, which stores task, attendance, or report data during disconnection and pushes them to the central database upon reconnection through the ASP.NET Core API.
Notifications are modeled as a separate entity that stores system-generated or user-directed messages, with metadata such as status, timestamps, and recipient references.
All data operations support timestamping (created/updated), foreign key relationships, and normalized subtypes (e.g issue_type, status, priority).

3.5.1 Synchronization Mechanism
The system implements an offline-first synchronization mechanism to address the operational challenges of municipal fieldwork environments where network connectivity is often weak or intermittent. The mechanism ensures uninterrupted field operation while maintaining data consistency between mobile devices and the central database.
Local Data Capture and Storage
Field activities such as attendance registration, task updates, and issue reporting are initially recorded in the local Hive database on the user's mobile device.
Each record includes two timestamps:
* Event Time: the exact moment when the action occurred on the device.
* Sync Time: the moment when the record was successfully transmitted to the server.
This dual-timestamp model preserves the chronological order of events even when synchronization is delayed and facilitates accurate auditing after data transmission.
Synchronization and Communication
Once connectivity is re-established, the Flutter application automatically synchronizes pending records with the ASP.NET Core API.
Data are transmitted in small batches to minimize bandwidth and battery consumption.
Each record carries a unique identifier to prevent duplication and ensure idempotent processing on the server.
The backend writes the synchronized data to the SQL Server database and returns acknowledgment messages containing any computed or updated attributes.
Conflict Resolution
If multiple users update the same record, the ASP.NET Core API resolves conflicts deterministically by retaining the version with the most recent valid event time while archiving the previous version in an audit log.
This process guarantees both operational continuity and data accountability.
Performance and Power Optimization
To enhance performance and conserve resources, media files are compressed before upload, non-critical synchronization tasks are deferred to idle periods, and location tracking frequency is reduced when the device is stationary.
These optimizations ensure compliance with the system's non-functional requirements for efficiency and reliability.
User Interface Feedback
The mobile interface displays synchronization states such as Pending, Syncing, and Synced to provide users with clear operational feedback.
Network interruptions do not block user actions, and any failed synchronization triggers a visible notification allowing manual retry.
This design promotes usability for non-technical users and supports an intuitive Arabic-language interface.
The offline-first approach was selected for the following reasons:
* Functional reliability: guarantees continuous operation in areas without network coverage.
* Performance: enables near-instant local data writes with lightweight synchronization.
* User experience: eliminates delays or interface freezes during connectivity loss.
* Device suitability: optimized for mid-range municipal devices with limited resources.
* Data integrity: preserves both event and synchronization timestamps for accurate auditing.
This synchronization mechanism provides robust, fault-tolerant communication between mobile clients and the central server, ensuring consistent data integrity and operational stability in real-world field conditions.

3.5.2 GIS Integration Clarification
The system integrates with the municipality's Geographic Information System (GIS) using official shapefile datasets supplied by the GIS department.
Each shapefile defines operational work zones as polygonal boundaries identified by a unique Zone ID.
This file-based approach was selected for its reliability, offline capability, and alignment with municipal data management practices.
Zone data and validation process:
Shapefile data are processed to extract zone boundaries and identifiers. Both the mobile application and the backend utilize this data to perform point-in-polygon validation. During attendance check-in/out, the system verifies that a worker's GPS coordinates fall within the assigned zone, while during task creation or completion, the corresponding Zone ID is attached to the record to ensure spatial accuracy. When operating offline, validation is executed locally using preloaded shapefiles; once connectivity is restored, validation is re-confirmed server-side through the ASP.NET Core API before the record is stored in SQL Server.
Version control and updates:
Whenever the municipality updates its zoning maps, the GIS department provides new shapefiles labeled with a ZoneVersion identifier. The system automatically applies these updates when connectivity allows, while preserving historical definitions for accurate reporting and auditing.
Performance and scalability:
To maintain responsiveness, shapefiles are optimized by simplifying polygon geometry and applying spatial indexing. This ensures efficient validation even on mid-range devices with limited processing power, meeting the system's non-functional performance requirements.
Advantages of the shapefile-based approach:
This method enables accurate offline validation without reliance on live GIS APIs. It ensures spatial precision using official municipal data, provides instant boundary display without latency, supports internal updates without third-party dependency, eliminates ongoing subscription costs, and protects privacy by processing all location data locally.
Impact on workflow:
Each attendance record, task entry, and issue report is permanently linked to its Zone ID. This allows supervisors to filter and analyze data by geographic area through the web dashboard, supporting precise spatial analytics and alignment with official municipal zones.
